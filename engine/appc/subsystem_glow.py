"""Subsystem glow-dimming driver (impulse, sensors, warp).

Pure mapping logic (state classification, edge tracking, dim/flicker mapping,
warp-pod enumeration) plus a thin per-ship orchestration object that registers
glow regions at construction and pushes state each frame. The C++ side owns the
region geometry and the shader attenuation; this module only decides *when* and
*how* a region dims. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-subsystem-glow-dimming-design.md.
