"""AnimationManager — App.g_kAnimationManager.

Real (no longer a loud stub), mirroring engine/appc/bridge_set.py::ModelManager:
our renderer loads animation NIFs lazily host-side, so the faithful equivalent
of the SDK's g_kAnimationManager.LoadAnimation is to remember the file path the
SDK registers under each animation NAME. The host reads it back with path_for
when it captures an officer's placement clip (see engine/appc/bridge_placement).

Loads nothing into the renderer itself; pure name -> path bookkeeping.
